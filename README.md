Inventory Management System built using Java 11, JavaFX, JavaDocs, and the IntelliJ IDEA CE IDE.  Utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.

This is a fully functional Inventory Management system that lets you create parts and put those parts together into products. It has associated names, counts, and prices with each; and also lets you put more details for them.  You can add, modify, and delete as necesary.  The system also have a handful of safeguards (You can't have a product be cheaper than the sum of its parts) and internal limitations built in.
